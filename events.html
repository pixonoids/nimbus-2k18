									A Hovercraft is a vehicle that flies like a plane but can float like a boat, can drive like a car
									but will traverse ditches and gullies as it is a flat terrain. A Hovercraft also sometimes called
									an air cushion vehicle because it can hover over or move across land or water surfaces while
									being held off from the surfaces by a cushion of air.
									Modern Hovercrafts are used for many applications where people and equipment need to travel
									at speed over water but be able load and unload on land. For example, they are used as
									passenger or freight carriers, as recreational machines and even use as warships. Hovercrafts
									are very exciting to fly and feeling of effortlessly traveling from land to water and back again
									is unique.

										The proposed robot uses four motors for running it in desired directions. We use
										a small bracket for pouring seeds. The robot consists of a funnel like arrangement in order to
										pour seeds into a lower container. There, we use a shaft with gear like bucket teeth to pick up
										limited quantity of seeds and pour them on the ground in a steady manner in proper quantity.
										The front of the robot can be further fitted with a bent plate that drags on the soil to make a
										slot ahead of the machine before the seeds are poured in it. The back portion of the robot can
										be fitted with a tail like bent rod that is again used to pour soil on seeds sowed thus covering
										them with soil.

									Engineer of the year is basically an on the spot event in which we test the skills, imagination and technical info of participants. This event consists of two rounds. In the first round, by using the given materials a hydraulic bridge is to be made and its strength will be tested according to how much weight it can bear. The winners will be short listed and in the second round using the knowledge of hydraulics, a crusher has to be made. Basing on its strength and ability to crush substances, the winner will be decided. Hope to see your participation

									Prepare and get placed in the easiest way possible. Stay a step ahead of the competition by practicing with our mock placement. It’s not so uncustomary to have few dream companies at the back of the mind before you even are in the final year of your studies. But, once you have jotted down what your dream companies are, what’s next? We are here to give you that placement feel with aptitude test followed by group discussion leading towards personal interviews, conducted by our professionals. The more you practice your dream company’s placement tests, the more are your chances to get the foot in the door.

									The idea is to make edible water bottles, a blob like water container. This biodegradable blob aims to provide convenience of plastic bottles while limiting the environmental impact. A demo will be provided for the formation of bottles by the team members. And then in the competition you have to create OHOO bottles of appropriate size with raw materials (sodium alginate, calcium lactate and water) issued by us in restricted period of time and fixed amount. It is a small initiative by us to contribute to the environment. These bottles come in various flavours and colours, as desired making it more fun, cheap and reliable. This is an on the spot event whose main requirement is your presence. Hope to see your participation.

									Rocketile is a type of rocket propellent for model rockets made with isopropyl alcohol as a fuel and spark of fire as igniter. The idea is to make isopropyl alcohol powered rocket with waste water bottle, so as to replace them with fire work rockets, since fireworks can be very dangerous and are prone to landing on things that might be combustible. This has made fireworks difficult. Most cities have completely outlawed fireworks within the city limit. The participants will learn about the alcohol rockets and how they work and how different aerodynamic designs can affect the height of flight.

									Our event focuses on making a simple centrifugal water pump. It is an on the spot event where participants will be provided with motors, GI sheet and other basics. The participants will be allowed to take part in a team of max two. The participants will be evaluated on basis of their design and the capacity of their pump to deliver water for certain height and flow. Successful completion of the task within minimum time will decide the winner. The event is focused to test the technical skills of participant and knowledge of fluid dynamics by how they design the pump. HOPE TO SEE YOU IN THE EVENTS!!

											<p>A diagrid structure is that, there is no vertical columns present in the perimeter of a diagrid building, therefore allowing significant flexibility with the floor plan. Vertical column in the core are designed for carrying gravity loads only and the diagrid is useful for both gravity and lateral loading. In this event the participants are supposed to construct a triangular diagrid  model using sticks, glue and MDF sheet, which helps them to enhances the knowledge about the distribution of loads i.e. tension & compression distributed in arch and triangles.</p>

									<p>Concrete is probably the most extensively used construction material in the world with about six billion tones being produced every year. The reduction of cement consumption by partial replacement of cement by supplementary materials. Every team will be given constituents and are required to cast a 15*15*15 cm^3 concrete cube which must exhibit high strength characters. You have to bring your own composition, we will just provide the materials.</p>

									As human beings, we  respond to stimuli. Our actions are due to the feedback given by our sensory
									organs. An edge detection event is the simplest way to demonstrate that. Sensing an edge and maneuvering the robot to stay on arena for a given time period.Obstacle avoider bot basically detect the edge of arena.If it is detecting an edge it will respond such that it will not fall down. Robot have to stay on arena for a given period of time .
